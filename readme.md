Google Reader migration between Google accounts
===============================================

This script (when finished) will be used to migrate ALL of my Google Reader
settings from current account I use for Reader (@gmail.com) to my actual
Google Apps account (@laacz.lv).

What I am able to mgirate now
-----------------------------

* Subscriptions
* Subscription labels (tags, folders)
* Starred items

What I will be able to migrate once finished
--------------------------------------------

* Shared items with annotations (notes, if they have one)
* Friends I follow
* Yet unread items
* Permanently marked as unread items

Files
-----

Since filenames are not straightforward, I will try and carefully explain
meaning of each file.

@greader.php contains Google Reader API stuff.
@migrate.php contains migration script.
